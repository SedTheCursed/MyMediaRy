# MyMediaRy

Multimedia library manager for mobile device, desktop and web.

## Why MyMediaRy?

    Not MyLibraRy, MyMediaRy, because you own more than books!

Nowadays people have books under different formats, physical but also digital ones, should it be on a reader or as files
on a computer. But their "library" isn't often limited to books, but also contains music, videos, games, and so forth.\
If there is applications for each format, one which is multimedia seems lacking, hence MyMediaRy.

### Why the multiplatform?
The application is Android first, but some of the functionalities, such as registering items manually, can benefit from
a bigger device with keyboard.

## Usage:

**/Design** contains the files useful for the planning and design phases, such as the specifications and
the UML diagrams.
